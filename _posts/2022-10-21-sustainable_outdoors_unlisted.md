## Summary

Land access rights in England and Wales severely restrict the public from freely accessing local outdoor green spaces for leisure and exercise. Improving these rights is crucial to moving towards a more sustainable outdoors that is fairer to people of different backgrounds, less polluted, and more natural. Recent campaigns which have gained popularity during the pandemic have called for more public and government action on this issue. In this article, we analyse various sources of public data to show that, while public appreciation of the outdoors and local nature has increased since the pandemic, there is a need to give the public wider access to paths and areas of land to sustain this trend. It is hoped that this article will promote awareness of the importance of land access rights in striving towards a more sustainable and fair outdoors for the population of England and Wales and inspire others to follow suit. 

## The Benefits of Outdoor Spaces

Access to the outdoors, nature, and green spaces is vital to humans for exercise, mental well-being, creativity, and many other benefits. In the UK, not long ago, coronavirus-induced lockdowns removed the public’s freedom to explore the outdoors, forcing us to make the most of whatever local green space we had on our doorstep. However, two years of these restrictions have [changed the UK’s attitudes](http://www.ramblers.org.uk/thegrassisntgreener) and we can now expect more interest in exploring these local outdoor spaces for recreation and exercise. As well as the restrictions of the pandemic, increased awareness of sustainability and environmental issues amongst the population [has also contributed to this shift](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/four-out-of-five-uk-consumers-adopt-more-sustainable-lifestyle-choices-during-covid-19-pandemic.html). From a sustainability point of view, better access to local natural spaces is desirable, paving the way for a wide variety of social and environmental benefits:

*   Lower emissions, pollution and congestion as well as [better quality of life](http://www.ramblers.org.uk/thegrassisntgreener) associated with travel to natural spaces for exercise and recreation.
*   Better public awareness of issues facing nature and the environment, as well as a [more responsible approach to the outdoors](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/people-are-right-to-trespass-in-fight-for-right-to-roam-in-england-says-green-mp-caroline-lucas). Reclaiming land for public use also contributes to the discussion of the importance of land ownership and use issues in tackling the [climate and nature crises](https://whoownsengland.org/2022/04/27/why-land-ownership-is-crucial-climate-nature-crises/).
*   More [sustainable tourism](https://www.nationalparksengland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/26780/NPE-Position-Statement-Sustainable-Tourism-2013.pdf), to conserve beauty and support rural communities, for example in mitigating tourist hotspots in National Parks.
*   Increased fairness of access to the outdoors; access to local nature is unequal across, for example, [ethnicity or income](https://neweconomics.org/2021/01/escaping-green-deprivation), and this issue has been exacerbated by lockdowns.

It is unsurprising that access to and within local outdoor spaces highly depends on land access rights. However, in England, (figures are similar in Wales, but rights differ in Scotland and Northern Ireland), current rights dictate that the [public have the right to freely access only 8% of land around the country](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/policy/england/access/access-to-wild-open-countryside-or-the-right-to-roam.aspx) and are excluded from the remaining enclosed private land under the fear of trespass. Such places include high-walled aristocratic country estates (G. Shrubsole, Who owns England?, 2019), golf courses or gardens hidden behind a National Trust membership. Campaigns, such as those of the [Ramblers](https://dontloseyourway.ramblers.org.uk/), [Wildlife and Countryside Link](https://www.wcl.org.uk/nature-for-everyone.asp) and [Right to Roam](https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/), are advocating for the reclamation of land to support nature and for public access, arguing for its environmental and health-related benefits as well as its historical and legal importance.

In this article, we argue that a data-backed approach can support these campaigns to reclaim local outdoor spaces. We present recent data reflecting how the public interact with the outdoors and nature around the country and discuss why this necessitates an improvement in land access rights in the UK.

## Importance of Local Natural Spaces

During the multiple UK coronavirus lockdowns, [UK restrictions](http://web.archive.org/web/20210107005810/https:/www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#exercising) prohibited travelling “outside your local area” to exercise and walk, and permitted local “public outdoor places” to stay open, including parks, “countryside accessible to the public”, gardens, and “the grounds of a heritage site”. This automatically highlighted the importance of having access to local outdoor spaces, which for most of the public meant nearby public urban parks and paths crossing local countryside, but for a select few, also the grounds of their own estates.

Data collected during this time showed that the number of people around the country walking for leisure and exercise rose higher than before the pandemic, especially those getting out several times a week, with walking one of the few things one could do out of the house (Figure 1). Local green spaces were crucial in giving the public the opportunity to get outside and improve their mental health. Furthermore, another survey’s data showed that an increasing proportion of the public said that they were [spending more time outside](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/howhaslockdownchangedourrelationshipwithnature/2021-04-26) than before the pandemic. To encourage people to continue exploring and exercising outdoors and having an interest in nature after the pandemic, we must ensure that more natural spaces are accessible to the public in England and Wales (as explained [here](https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/)).

_Figure 1:_ _Proportion of adults who walk for leisure averaged across all of England from 2016 to 2021, according to the [Active Lives Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/walking-and-cycling-statistics-cw) by Sport England. This graph incorporates the recently released 2021 survey data not included on past reports; 2022 survey data is scheduled for release in summer 2023._

To support the idea that these outdoor spaces remain important even after the pandemic has ended, recent data presented in Figure 2 showed that both interest in exercising locally and leisure visits to green spaces has stayed at an elevated level compared to before the pandemic – in particular, local exercise interest remains at a statistically significant higher level than before. This suggests the prolonged importance of local outdoor spaces, supporting the focus on sustainable access to the outdoors long after the pandemic.
