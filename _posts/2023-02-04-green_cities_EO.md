## Introduction

Cities that are best prepared for a smart city future should be sustainable, according to the recent 2022 [ProptechOS](https://proptechos.com/smart-city-index/) report which benchmarks cities in US and Europe on a selection of indicators. This is backed up by the [OECD smart cities definition](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/cities/Smart-cities-measurement-framework-scoping.pdf). In the report, sustainability is measured using a green infrastructure indicator in 46 European cities, combining: 

- Number of EV charging points per capita
- Number of green certified buildings according to [GBIG](https://www.gbig.org/) in 2022, such as BREEAM or LEED

This prompts the following question. How do we measure the environmental sustainability of cities? We see that certain cities, such as London, that perform well in green infrastructure also perform well in some other sustainability measures, but not so well in others.

## What is urban environmental sustainability?

Although they represent lower emissions, the numbers of EV charging points and green certified buildings measure environmental progress in a (current) model of urbanisation centred around more cars and buildings. According to the [UN Habitat World Cities Report 2022](https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2022/06/wcr_2022.pdf), it’s important that the future city goal should place environmental sustainability at its core, but we must consider a multitude of desirable outcomes. For example, electric cars play only one part in a wider approach to sustainable urban mobility.

The [European Environment Agency’s reports](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/urban-environment) present an urban environmental sustainability framework that pulls together many different building blocks for a common goal, described through the lenses of a city that is green, low-carbon, resilient, circular, inclusive and healthy. We will study the following factors:

- Sustainable mobility and infrastructure
- Energy efficiency and built environment quality
- Renewable energy
- Environmental quality
- Green spaces and nature quality
- Zero waste

## Analysis
Other organisations have recently published indicators measuring the above urban environmental sustainability factors in cities around Europe. We look at how some of these published indicators compare to those published by ProptechOS. Do cities perform well in one indicator but perform badly in others?

#### [2019 SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities](https://euro-cities.sdgindex.org/)

We include in our analysis the following [indicators](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sustainabledevelopment.report/2019/2019_sdg_index_euro_cities.pdf) originally covering 45 European cities, covering parts of the UN [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDG) 7, 11, 12, 13, 15 linked to environmental sustainability:

- [SDG15](https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/15-life-on-land/) (life on land), measuring environmental quality:
  - Urban green area (also included separately)
  - Natura 2000 area in good quality
  - Soil sealing
  - Surface water of good ecological status
- Renewable energy generated for SDG7 (affordable and clean energy)
- Air quality metrics: concentration of particulate matter and emission of nitrogen oxides, as part of SDG11 (sustainable cities)
- Recycling rate and waste quantity, as part of SDG12 (responsible consumption)
- Urban CO2 emissions for SDG13 climate action

#### [Clean Cities Campaign 2022 rankings](https://cleancitiescampaign.org/ranking-2022-edition/)

We include in our analysis the following transparently and robustly researched indicators originally covering 36 European cities, that prioritise zero-emissions mobility:

- Space for people (opportunity for cycling and pedestrians, congestion)
- Accessibility to climate-friendly mobility - e.g. public transport availability and affordability, EV-charger availability
- Policies score relating to policy pressure on polluting mobility and services offering climate-friendly mobility

## Discussion

**Recycling rate.** We see a fairly strong positive trend, showing that cities prioritising green infrastructure are also progressive in waste management.

**Climate policies.** A very strong positive trend, showing that the development of certain infrastructure is associated with strong climate-positive policy decisions with regards to other infrastructure.

**SDG15: life on land.** We see an interesting positive and negative trend in the quality of nature and environment. Cities like Ljubljana and Zagreb are at the top of SDG15 despite being lower on the Green Infrastructure scale, whereas cities considered more highly developed such as Amsterdam or London perform worse in SDG15, showing a higher negative impact on the environment and ecology. One notable exception is Oslo.

**Access to climate-friendly mobility and Space for people.** A positive trend with notable outliers, showing that in some cities, sustainable mobility covers much more than electric vehicles. For example, London is known for being poorly cyclable and suffers from congestion.

**Air quality (concentration PM2.5)**. We see cities clustered into groups. A few major cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam, London and Paris have highly developed infrastructure but moderate air pollution as measured by concentration of PM2.5. Scandinavian cities, along with Madrid, Lisbon and Dublin perform well in terms of air quality. Predominantly Eastern European cities form the group with the worst air quality.
