## Get in touch

Get in touch via [email](mailto:andrew.wang@ed.ac.uk) or [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/andrewwang27).


## Work

I'm building a startup [Blur Labs](https://blurlabs.ai/)! We are building open-source AI foundation models for image reconstruction. Powering the next generation of faster, cheaper imaging devices.

Interested in imaging? Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blurlabs) or [get in touch](#get-in-touch) with me.

Blur Labs is based in Paris and proudly supported by [Inria Startup Studio](https://www.inriastartupstudio.fr).

### Research

I was a PhD researcher at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-michael-e-davies).

I design deep learning algorithms for solving real-world inverse imaging problems where we rarely have ground truth, such as accelerating medical imaging or higher resolution Earth observation.

[Get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you are interested in **computer vision**, **inverse problems**, **unsupervised deep learning**, **geometric deep learning**, **compressed sensing**, **medical imaging** or **Earth observation**.

Check out my [CV](https://andrewwango.github.io/cv.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=00ET0NAAAAAJ).

### Software

I am a lead maintainer for [**DeepInverse**](https://deepinv.github.io), the Python library for imaging with deep learning.

I'm open to freelance work! Check out my [project portfolio](https://andrewwango.github.io).

## Activism

I'm an activist and campaigner for better access to nature and the outdoors for everyone.

I founded [ESEA Outdoors UK](https://eseaoutdoors.uk), a grassroots community to advocate for better representation, diversity and inclusion in the outdoors.

I'm on the board of [National Trails UK](https://www.nationaltrails.uk/), a national charity championing and campaigning for National Trails across the UK.

To learn more about these topics, check out my [list of Resources](https://eseaoutdoors.uk/resources/) and [Substack](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.substack.com/).
