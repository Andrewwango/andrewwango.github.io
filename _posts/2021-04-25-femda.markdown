Output of my research at CentraleSupélec, during my 5-weeks internship in the [Laboratoire des signaux et systèmes](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/). Flexible EM-Inspired Discriminant Analysis is a robust supervised classification algorithm that performs well in heterogeneous or noisy and contaminated datasets. [femda](https://github.com/Andrewwango/femda) is implemented as a scikit-learn estimator and is available [here](https://github.com/Andrewwango/femda).
