Summary of my research at CentraleSupélec, in the [Laboratoire des signaux et systèmes](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/). Flexible EM-Inspired Discriminant Analysis is a robust supervised classification algorithm that performs well in heterogeneous or noisy and contaminated datasets. [femda](https://github.com/Andrewwango/femda) is implemented as a scikit-learn estimator.

#### Get started
```python
>>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
>>> from femda import FEMDA
>>> X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
>>> clf = FEMDA()
>>> clf.fit(X, y)
FEMDA()
>>> clf.score(X, y)
0.9666666666666667
```

Using a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`...

```python
>>> from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
>>> from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
>>> X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)
>>> pipe = make_pipeline(PCA(n_components=5), FEMDA()).fit(X, y)
>>> pipe.predict(X)
...
```

#### Run the experiments presented in the paper
```python
>>> from femda.experiments import run_experiments()

#### Abstract
Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis are well-known classical methods but can heavily suffer from non-Gaussian distributions and/or contaminated datasets, mainly because of the underlying Gaussian assumption that is not robust. To fill this gap, this paper presents a new robust discriminant analysis where each data point is drawn by its own arbitrary Elliptically Symmetrical (ES) distribution and its own arbitrary scale parameter. Such a model allows for possibly very heterogeneous, independent but non-identically distributed samples. After deriving a new decision rule, it is shown that maximum-likelihood parameter estimation and classification are very simple, fast and robust compared to state-of-the-art methods.
