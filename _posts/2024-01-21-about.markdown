## Research

I'm a PhD research student at the [Institute for Imaging, Data and Communications](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/idcom) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-michael-e-davies).

I design deep learning algorithms for solving real-world inverse imaging problems where we rarely have ground truth, such as accelerating medical imaging or higher resolution Earth observation. These problems are super important but very challenging - how do we know what a black hole is supposed to look like before ever imaging one?

## Activism

I'm an activist and campaigner for better access to nature and the outdoors for everyone. See below for previous writing and speaking.

I founded [ESEA Outdoors UK](https://eseaoutdoors.uk), a grassroots community to advocate for better representation, diversity and inclusion in the outdoors.

I'm on the board of [National Trails UK](https://www.nationaltrails.uk/), a national charity championing and campaigning for National Trails across the UK.

To learn more about these topics, check out my [list of Resources](https://eseaoutdoors.uk/resources/) and [Substack](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.substack.com/).
