## Research

I'm a PhD research student at the [Institute for Imaging, Data and Communications](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/idcom) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-michael-e-davies).

I'm developing unsupervised ML methodologies for solving inverse imaging problems. These problems appear in many critical imaging scenarios: accelerating medical imaging, higher resolution Earth observation, electron microscopy etc. We rarely have ground truth in the real world - how do we know what a black hole is supposed to look like before ever imaging a black hole - motivating the need for provable unsupervised techniques. 

[Get in touch](mailto:andrew.wang@ed.ac.uk) if you are interested in **computer vision**, **inverse problems**, **unsupervised deep learning**, **geometric deep learning**, **compressed sensing**, **medical imaging** or **Earth observation**.

## Activism

I'm an activist and campaigner for better access to nature and the outdoors for everyone. See below for previous writing and speaking.

I founded [ESEA Outdoors UK](https://www.instagram.com/eseaoutdoorsuk/) [_(about)_](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.carrd.co/), a grassroots community to advocate for better representation, diversity and inclusion in the outdoors.

I'm a Trustee of [National Trails UK](https://www.nationaltrails.uk/), where my interest is in enabling underrepresented and marginalised people to access nature.

I'm also interested in the data of [UK land access rights](https://andrewwango.github.io/prow-map/).

To learn more about these topics, check out our [list of Resources](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.github.io/resources/) and [Substack](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.substack.com/).
