I'm a PhD research student at the [Institute for Imaging, Data and Communications](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/idcom) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-michael-e-davies).

I'm developing unsupervised ML methodologies for solving inverse imaging problems. These problems appear in many critical imaging scenarios: accelerating medical imaging, higher resolution Earth observation, electron microscopy etc. We rarely have ground truth in the real world - how do we know what a black hole is supposed to look like before ever imaging a black hole - motivating the need for provable unsupervised techniques. My interests include **computer vision**, **inverse problems**, **unsupervised deep learning**, **physics-informed ML**, **compressed sensing**, **medical imaging** and **earth observation**.

As a keen fell-runner and climber, I'm campaigning to improve access to the outdoors. I founded [ESEA Outdoors UK](https://www.instagram.com/eseaoutdoorsuk/) [_(about)_](https://eseaoutdoorsuk.carrd.co/), a grassroots community to advocate for better representation, diversity and inclusion in the outdoors.

I‚Äôm also excited to have joined the [National Trails UK](https://www.nationaltrails.uk/) Board as a Trustee, where my interest is in enabling underrepresented and marginalised people to access nature. The UK is facing a triple nature, climate and social crisis and landscapes such as National Trails are crucial for fighting biodiversity loss, improving access to the outdoors for everyone and promoting sustainable tourism.

I'm also interested in [UK land access rights](https://andrewwango.github.io/sustainable_outdoors/).
