## Background

[The Software Alliance, Northern Ireland](https://softwarealliancenorthernirelan.godaddysites.com/about) exists to lobby and drive strategy and policy development to ensure that Northern Ireland becomes the world leading region for innovative software.  

The Software Alliance acknowledges the inequity of access and low uptake of computing education in primary and post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. To tackle the computing education challenges, The Software Alliance Board will conduct a landscape review of the education ecosystem.  

At Kainos, a company headquartered in Belfast and a member of the alliance, we recognise that computing education is important for our success. Alongside our [other outreach activities](https://www.kainos.com/insights/news/kainos-tech-outreach-programme-receives-highly-commended-honour-responsible-business-awards), a first step is analysing the data of current and past computing education in Northern Ireland.

To determine the uptake in students obtaining an IT/Computing qualification, the following data sets were made available:
