### Pulled pork <a id="pulled-pork"></a>
#### Mix of several online recipes + lessons learnt from first time in 2021. Adapted for easy home cooking.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cooking/pulled-pork.png" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>


**Ingredients**

- Pork shoulder from the supermarket, following quantities assume 1.4kg of meat. Choose one that doesn't look like it's falling apart, and with a small fat/skin cap.
- Spice rub (flexible - most things optional): BBQ seasoning (check ingredients and adapt following quantities appropriately), 1 cup combined brown+white sugar, paprika, smoked paprika (to emulate smoker effect but not too much unless you like it like that) garlic/ginger/onion powder, salt+pepper, mustard powder, oregano.
- Cooking liquid: maybe a cider/beer, some cider vinegar, some water - doesn't really matter.
- Sauce ingredients: ketchup, vinegar, onion, optional: molasses, chipotle, Worcestershire sauce

**Method**

1. Trim off most of fat cap and pat dry. Use fat cap for crackling (pat dry, score, rub with salt and oil, oven/grill at high heat.)
2. Generously and **thoroughly** apply spice rub.
3. The pork needs to be cooked in the oven covered with a source of humidity. Place on rack elevated above a roasting tray with liquid inside (e.g. [this](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/koncis-roasting-tin-with-grill-rack-stainless-steel-10099053/)) and cover whole tray with foil, or place on metal rack inside large casserole dish with lid with liquid inside. Make sure fat is facing up. 
4. Cook low and slow - 140°C/120°C fan for >6 hours, the longer the better. Optionally for last hour turn up heat slightly and uncover slightly to develop crust and evaporate some liquid. Remove and rest.
5. BBQ sauce: sauté diced onion, add splash vinegar, ketchup (forms base of sauce), some sugar/honey, optional: molasses/soy sauce/Worcestershire sauce/anything else, garlic powder. Add juices from roasting tray. Simmer until thick.
6. Pull pork with 2 forks and mix in sauce.
