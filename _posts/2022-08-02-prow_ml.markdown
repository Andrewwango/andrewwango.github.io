A project to automatically analyse all footpaths in England and Wales to find lost public rights of way (PRoW) using analysis of public GPX traces. In conjunction with [Joe Thorogood](https://rowresearch.coventry.domains/contact/).

## Introduction

### Motivation

### Aims

## Datasets

- **Public data**: A good source of public GPS activity (e.g. walking, cycling, driving) is provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) [API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#GPS_traces), which delivers anonymised tracks in a given region. We use an [agglomerated dump of this data](http://zverik.openstreetmap.ru/gps/files/extracts/europe/great_britain/index.html) from 2013 to speed up data download. In future it would be nice to use a more modern source such as [Strava Metro](https://metro.strava.com/).

- **Right of Way data**: A dataset of public rights of way from the definitive maps of each authority is kindly shared [here](https://www.rowmaps.com/) in one convenient API. Currently data for 121 authorities in England and Wales is available, see [here](https://www.rowmaps.com/gpxs/).

- **Base path network**: A comprehensive path network, onto which the above datasets are overlaid, is available from OSM. This includes all public and private paths that have made it onto [OSM](openstreetmap.org/). A dataset containing only paths (and not roads) is downloaded using [OSMNX](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io). 

## Algorithm

The aim here is to combine the data detailing public usage of paths with the PRoW data into a single geodataset of paths to be displayed.

1. Map-match public GPS dataset and PRoW dataset to OSM path network using `osmnx`, to remove traces that are spurious or on highways.
2. Join path datasets using `geopandas`. Label paths with measure of "activity".
3. Filter and smooth using `networkx`.
4. Query paths with non-zero activity but are not RoW from geodataset. Render colour-coded paths over an OSM map using `folium`.

## Deliverables

1. A geodataset of path entries labelled with PRoW (yes/no) and public activity, and tagged with OSM IDs for further feature analysis.
2. An online map presenting the data stored on server, showing analysed paths.

The online map is available on the [web-app](https://andrewwango.github.io/prow-web-app). An example is shown below:

_OSM paths that have some public activity but are not PRoW, in Bedford, UK. Yellow-red = low-high activity._
